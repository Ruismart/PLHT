Description: Using mouse intestinal scRNAseq WT data (Epcam+ Epithelial & Pdgfra+ Mesenchymal) and trajectory features merged/filtered from stage-DEGs (P00-P07-P14-P21-P28), we have built a PCA-based linear model to regress A holistical time coordinate along postnatal development, which could be applied to the comparison of maturity level between CTL-vs-CKO, as well within any other normalized singlecell or bulk transcriptome datasets.
